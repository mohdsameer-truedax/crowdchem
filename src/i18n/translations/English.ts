      "content": "On real roads, tires don’t get to pick the weather. One day it is hot, dry asphalt and the next one it’s snowy. In tires, the tread is the heart of vehicle control: what you decide here dictates how the car brakes and how it finds traction on both dry asphalt and snow. Historically, a tread that feels razor-sharp in the dry goes vague in snow, and a snow-biased recipe goes much on clean pavement. When the formulation leans too far to one side, the risk is immediate."

# Exploring Text Formatting, Lists & Quotes in MDX

## Blockquotes & Inspiration

> “Knowledge is power.”  
> - *Francis Bacon*

> “The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existence.”  
> - *Albert Einstein*

Blockquotes are perfect for embedding notable statements or highlighting insights from researchers or founders.  
In scientific writing, they help differentiate expert opinions or summarize paper abstracts clearly.

## Lists in Action

### Unordered List

- **Machine Learning Models** improve with data.
- **Molecular Dynamics** simulations require precision.
  - Use temperature control algorithms (e.g. Berendsen thermostat).
  - Analyze potential energy surfaces carefully.
- **AI-driven automation** reduces experimental errors.

### Ordered List

1. Prepare your **dataset** of molecular compounds.  
2. Clean and normalize the data.  
3. Train your **predictive model** for structure-activity relationships.
   1. Use a neural architecture like GraphConv or GNN.  
   2. Evaluate using *mean absolute error (MAE)* metrics.
4. Generate a **compound performance report**.
